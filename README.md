SPOJ Tweaks
===========

Chrome extension for small tweaks on the SPOJ website, adjusted for the new layout of the site, heavily based on the previous work of [pulkitsharma07](https://github.com/pulkitsharma07/Better-SPOJ).

Features
--------
* Classical problems have a Points column right next to Users column in the problemset.

![Points next to the problems.](https://github.com/kubik369/spoj-chrome-extension/blob/master/problemset.png "Classical problems problem set.")

* Points are displayed under the tags of the classical problem, challenges have the number of users who solved the problem.

![Points displayed on the problem page.](https://github.com/kubik369/spoj-chrome-extension/blob/master/problem.png "Classical problem.")

Features I want to add
----------------------
* Settings, where the user can select his/her favourite language and this language will always be picked as the default compilator and in challenge problems, the best solution in this language will be shown where the points are in the classical problems.

* Pop-up after the icon of the extension is clicked where the user could keep track of how many points/what rank are his/her friends.
